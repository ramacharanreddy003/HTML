        <h2> Machine Learning.</h2>
        <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI, which enables the machine to automatically learn from data, improve performance from past experiences, and make predictions. 
            Machine learning contains a set of algorithms that work on a huge amount of data. Data is fed to these algorithms to train them, and on the basis of training,
             they build the model & perform a specific task. These ML algorithms help to solve different business problems like Regression, Classification, Forecasting, Clustering, and Associations, etc. 
             Based on the methods and way of learning, machine learning is divided into mainly four types.</p>

        <p>Because it does no training at all when you supply the training data. At training time, all it is
 doing is storing the complete data set but it does not do any calculations at this point.
 Neither does it try to derive a more compact model from the data which it could use for
 scoring. Therefore, we call this algorithm lazy.
 We have seen that this algorithm is lazy and during training time all it is doing is to store all
 the data it gets. All the computation happens during scoring, i.e. when we apply the model
 on unseen data points. We need to determine which k data points out of our training set are
 closest to the data point we want to get a prediction for.</p>
