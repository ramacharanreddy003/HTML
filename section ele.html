            <h1>Types of Machine Learning</h1>
            <p class="ml">Machine learning is a subset of AI, which enables the machine to automatically learn from
 data, improve performance from past experiences, and make predictions. Machine learning
 contains a set of algorithms that work on a huge amount of data. Data is fed to these
 algorithms to train them, and on the basis of training, they build the model & perform a
 specific task.
 These ML algorithms help to solve different business problems like Regression, Classification,
 Forecasting, Clustering, and Associations, etc.
 Based on the methods and way of learning, machine learning is divided into mainly four
 types, which are:</p>

 <h1>Supervised Machine Learning :</h1>
 <p class="ml">As its name suggests, Supervised machine learning is based on supervision. It means in the
 supervised learning technique, we train the machines using the "labeled" dataset, and based
 on the training, the machine predicts the output. Here, the labeled data specifies that some
 of the inputs are already mapped to the output. More precisely, we can say; first, we train
 the machine with the input and corresponding output, and then we ask the machine to
 predict the output using the test dataset.
 Let's understand supervised learning with an example. Suppose we have an input dataset of
 cats and dog images. So, first, we will provide the training to the machine to understand the
 images, such as the shape & size of the tail of cat and dog, Shape of eyes, color, height
 (dogs are taller, cats are smaller), etc. After completion of training, we input the picture of a
 cat and ask the machine to identify the object and predict the output. Now, the machine is
 well trained, so it will check all the features of the object, such as height, shape, color, eyes,
 ears, tail, etc., and find that it's a cat. So, it will put it in the Cat category. This is the process
 of how the machine identifies the objects in Supervised Learning.
 The main goal of the supervised learning technique is to map the input variable(x) with
 the output variable(y). Some real-world applications of supervised learning are Risk
 Assessment, Fraud Detection, Spam filtering, etc.
 Categories of Supervised Machine Learning
 Supervised machine learning can be classified into two types of problems, which are given
 below:
 ● Classification
 ● Regression</p>
